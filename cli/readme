This readme will explain the basics of how to create a cli that will run basic commands in Go

The first step is to create a folder cli
This will contain the code to run

Create a file main.go

Add the imports and a main function

Initialise the project using 'go mod init -ProjectName-
This will create a go.mod that is like a package.json

To create an exe of the main.go use the command :
go build main.go

To execute use the following :
./main.exe start -v
